        <p>“19/20” captures the growth and freedom of young 19-year-olds as they turn 20. The show will follow various Gen Z’s as they enjoy their final week being 19 and their first week being 20 after ringing in 2023. The unique participants will close out the year by spending time with their friends and slowly but surely preparing for adulthood. They will begin attending “19 School”, where they will take lessons about useful things to know as an adult. On New Year’s Day, all the cast members will part ways with their parents and teachers to move into the “20 House,” a place of independence and the start of their new adult journey where they can showcase their colorful charms, create unexpected bonds and make meaningful memories.</p>
